Build
=====

SPARQL Query Benchmarker uses a mutli-module maven build.

Running mvn package in this directory will build all components.  You will
find the API under core/target and the CLI under cmd/target

The CLI builds as a shaded runnable JAR incorporating all dependencies so can
be run directly per the instructions under cmd/README

Scripts
-------

makeSrcDistro will generate a tar ball of this folder and all subfolders that
excludes any built artifacts (the target directories)
