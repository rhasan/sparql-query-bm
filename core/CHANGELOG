==========

- Added long format equivalents for all short format arguments e.g. --runs and -r
- Better error reporting and more consistent halting behaviour

Version 0.3.0 (January 10th 2012)
- Added support for multi-threaded benchmarking with configurable level of parallel threads
- Bug Fix to allow text/boolean for ASK results

Version 0.4.0 (January 11th 2012)

- Added note to README about multi-threaded benchmark stats

Version 0.5.0 (January 16th 2012)
- Added new statistics for multi-threaded benchmarks
 - Actual Runtime
 - Actual Average Runtime (Arithmetic)

- Revised CSV and Console output so that multi-threaded statistics are only included for multi-threaded runs
- Added API document
- Improved comments
- Added FileProgressListener and ConsoleErrProgressListener
- Error handling in the case where a progress listener throws an error including respecting benchmark halting options

Version 0.6.0 (January 23rd 2012)
- Added additional response time statistics
- Added --nocount option for disabling result counting
- Added --nocsv and --noxml options to disable CSV and XML outputs
- Change so that existing result files will not be overwritten and benchmarking won't run unless --overwrite option is specified
- Added -l/--limit option for enforcing a LIMIT on all queries, enforced limit is minimum of specified limit or existing query limit

Version 0.7.0 (February 13th 2012)
- Reworked how multi-threaded benchmarks are run to create a more realistic run environment

Version 0.8.0 (March 1st 2012)
- Support for SPARQL CSV

- Fixed a bug in the query randomizer which prevented it from randomizing the last query (last query always happened last)
- Added the query execution order to the XML output

Version 0.9.0 
- Changed so errors/timeouts record the time till error/timeout by default rather than Long.MAX_VALUE so they don't render stats unusable

Version 1.0.0

- Changed -f/--filename option to more accurate -c/--csv option
- Finalized documentation for first external release
- Bumped dependencies to stable Jena 2.7.1 release (Jena 2.7.1 and ARQ 2.9.1)
