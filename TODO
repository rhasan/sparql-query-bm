The following are a list of planned enhancements for this project:

- Use an RDF vocabulary to describe query mixes instead of current text file
	- Allows for marking queries to be included multiple times
	- Allows for adding user friendly names
	
- When the same query occurs multiple times in a mix the results are not currently amalgamated. It would be nice if
  the tool was capable of automatically doing this
	
- RdfProgressListener
	- Generate an RDF form output, define a vocabulary for this
	- Add a --rdf flag to set this file
	
- Don't require files/no output flag to be set for each standard listener, simply require at least one listener setting
  i.e. have the CLI manually register listeners rather than having listeners registered by default in API and CLI
       removing them

- Lag Compensation
	- Try to calculate how much delay in HTTP communications there is with the endpoint via simple GETs to the endpoint
	- Adjust all values for the endpoint by this delay
	
- XSLT Stylesheets for rendering XML results in usable form in browsers
